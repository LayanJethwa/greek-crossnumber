# Greek Crossnumber

This is a crossnumber puzzle (think crossword, but numbers) that I have created, but the answers are all in Ancient Greek!

I made this after a school lesson about the Greek numerals, with a bit of help from some Python (`crossnumber.py`).

The numbers are in 5th century Attic Greek, and have the least significant number on the rightmost side (they are written out in words, but in the Greek script).

This is a rather simplistic web page; it is only for the purpose of showcasing this project so I haven't put any work into it.
